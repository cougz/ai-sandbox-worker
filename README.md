# AI Sandbox Worker

A multi-user AI agent sandbox deployed on Cloudflare Workers. Exposes an MCP server that lets any MCP-compatible client (OpenCode, Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) execute JavaScript in isolated V8 sandboxes, operate on a persistent per-user filesystem, and generate shareable HTML reports — all authenticated via Cloudflare Access.

**Key design decisions:**

- `OAuthProvider` (from `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`) wraps `McpAgent.serve()` — the [officially recommended pattern](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai) for authenticated MCP servers on Workers.
- Workspaces are backed by **D1** (not the DO's ephemeral SQLite), so files persist across sessions.
- The `/view` endpoint is **public** — report links can be shared with anyone without requiring login.
- GitPrism (`gitprism.*`) is available in every sandbox via the MCP protocol, requiring no auth from this Worker's side.

---

## Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account on the **Workers Paid plan** (Dynamic Worker Loader requires it)
- Wrangler CLI: `npm install -g wrangler`
- Node.js 18+

---

## One-time infrastructure setup

### 1. KV namespace

`OAUTH_KV` and `USER_REGISTRY` share the existing KV namespace (`670e81fe1d294d50bbf1d1c6e5b9ded3`). Key prefixes don't collide (`oauth:*` vs `user:*`), so no new namespace is needed.

If starting from scratch:

```bash
wrangler kv namespace create USER_REGISTRY
# → outputs an ID; set both OAUTH_KV and USER_REGISTRY to that ID in wrangler.jsonc
```

### 2. Create the D1 workspace database

```bash
wrangler d1 create sandbox-workspaces
# → outputs a database_id, paste it into wrangler.jsonc under WORKSPACE_DB
```

### 3. Create the R2 bucket

```bash
wrangler r2 bucket create sandbox-storage
```

### 4. Update `wrangler.jsonc` with the IDs from steps 1–2

Replace `REPLACE_WITH_OAUTH_KV_ID` and `REPLACE_WITH_D1_ID` with the values printed by the commands above.

---

## Cloudflare Access setup (Zero Trust dashboard)

Authentication uses **Cloudflare Access for SaaS (OIDC)**. This gives you an OAuth server backed by your existing Identity Provider (Google, Okta, etc.) without managing OAuth infrastructure yourself.

### Step 1 — Ensure you have an Identity Provider configured

Zero Trust → Settings → Authentication → Add a provider (e.g. Google).

### Step 2 — Create an Access for SaaS application

Zero Trust → Access → Applications → **Add an application** → **SaaS**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Application name | `AI Sandbox MCP` |
| Application type | `OIDC` |
| Redirect URL | `https://ai-sandbox.cloudemo.org/callback` |
| Scopes | `openid`, `email`, `profile` |

Click **Save**. Note the values on the next screen:

| Secret name | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| `ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` | "Client ID" on the app page |
| `ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` | "Client secret" |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` | "Token endpoint" |
| `ACCESS_AUTHORIZATION_URL` | "Authorization endpoint" |
| `ACCESS_JWKS_URL` | "Key endpoint" |

### Step 3 — Add an Access policy

On the same application, add a policy:

- **Action:** Allow
- **Rule:** Emails ending in `@cloudflare.com`

This ensures only `@cloudflare.com` accounts can authenticate. The domain is also enforced server-side via the `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN` env var.

---

## Secrets

Set all secrets via Wrangler after deploying:

```bash
# Cloudflare Access for SaaS credentials (from step 2 above)
wrangler secret put ACCESS_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET
wrangler secret put ACCESS_TOKEN_URL
wrangler secret put ACCESS_AUTHORIZATION_URL
wrangler secret put ACCESS_JWKS_URL

# Cookie signing key — any long random string
wrangler secret put COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY
# e.g. openssl rand -hex 32

# Admin dashboard password
wrangler secret put ADMIN_SECRET
# e.g. openssl rand -hex 16
```

---

## Environment variables (`wrangler.jsonc` → `vars`)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLIC_URL` | `https://ai-sandbox.cloudemo.org` | Base URL used to build shareable `/view` links from `get_report_url`. Update if you use a different domain. |
| `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN` | `@cloudflare.com` | Server-side email domain check after Access login. Change to restrict to a different org. |

---

## KV bindings

| Binding | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OAUTH_KV` | OAuth provider state (client registrations, tokens, auth codes) | Managed automatically by `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` |
| `USER_REGISTRY` | Admin user listing — populated automatically on first login | Keys: `user:{email}` → `{email, name, createdAt}` |

---

## D1 binding

| Binding | Database name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WORKSPACE_DB` | `sandbox-workspaces` | Persistent workspace files per user (namespaced by email via `@cloudflare/shell`) |

---

## R2 binding

| Binding | Bucket name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `STORAGE` | `sandbox-storage` | Large file spill-over for workspace (files > threshold are stored here automatically) |

---

## Deploy

```bash
npm install
wrangler deploy
```

---

## Connecting OpenCode

Each user adds this to their `opencode.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "mcp": {
    "ai-sandbox": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://ai-sandbox.cloudemo.org/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**First time only** — run the auth flow:

```bash
opencode mcp auth ai-sandbox
```

A browser window opens → Cloudflare Access login → token stored in `~/.local/share/opencode/mcp-auth.json` → all future sessions are automatic.

---

## MCP tools

Once connected, the following tools are available in every session:

### `run_code`

Execute JavaScript in an isolated V8 sandbox (~2ms startup). No outbound network access.

Inside the sandbox:

| Namespace | Description |
|---|---|
| `state.*` | Full filesystem: `readFile`, `writeFile`, `glob`, `searchFiles`, `replaceInFiles`, `diff`, `readJson`, `writeJson`, `walkTree`, and more |
| `codemode.*` | Your custom TypeScript RPC tools (edit `src/tools/example.ts`) |
| `gitprism.*` | `ingest_repo({ url, detail? })` — converts any public GitHub repo to Markdown |

Files written via `state.*` persist permanently across all sessions for that user (backed by D1).

### `run_bundled_code`

Same as `run_code` but bundles npm packages at runtime so the sandbox can `import` them. Slower — prefer `run_code` for simple tasks.

### `get_report_url`

Returns a stable, shareable URL for any HTML file in the workspace. The link works without login (the `/view` endpoint is public).

---

## Admin dashboard

Visit `https://ai-sandbox.cloudemo.org/admin` and enter your `ADMIN_SECRET`.

Features:
- Lists all users who have authenticated (auto-populated)
- Shows file count per user's workspace
- Expand any user to see individual files, with **View ↗** links for HTML reports
- Wipe a user's entire workspace
- Delete individual files
- Remove a user from the registry (workspace data in D1 is preserved)

---

## Adding domain tools

Edit `src/tools/example.ts` to replace the stub KV tools with calls to your real services (databases, APIs, etc.):

```typescript
export const domainTools = {
  myQuery: {
    description: "Query my database",
    execute: async ({ sql }: { sql: string }) => {
      // This runs in the HOST Worker, not the sandbox.
      // Full access to env bindings, secrets, external APIs.
      return env.MY_D1.prepare(sql).all();
    },
  },
};
```

The LLM calls these as `codemode.myQuery({ sql: "..." })` inside the sandbox. The sandbox never has direct database access — it only sees return values.

---

## Report generation

Generate reports from the sandbox and get a shareable link:

```
User: "Analyse the pipeline data and create a dashboard"

→ run_code writes /reports/pipeline-dashboard.html
→ get_report_url returns: https://ai-sandbox.cloudemo.org/view?user=tim@cloudflare.com&file=/reports/pipeline-dashboard.html
```

The LLM can use any styling approach — write self-contained HTML with inline CSS and Chart.js, or store reusable design tokens in the workspace (e.g. `/templates/cf-base.css`, `/templates/cf-charts.js`) and read them back with `state.readFile` before composing the final report.

---

## Rooms for improvement

### Security

- **JWT verification uses Access JWKS** — currently fetches the JWKS on every callback. Should cache the public key in KV with a reasonable TTL to avoid the extra network round-trip and potential failures.
- **`/view` is fully public** — anyone with a URL can read any workspace file. Consider adding an optional `token` query parameter for sensitive reports, or gating `/view` behind Access with a bypass for specific file types.
- **Admin secret is a plain string header** — replace with Cloudflare Access protecting `/admin` directly (add a second Access Application scoped to your email only).
- **D1 workspace has no per-user isolation at the SQL level** — a bug or exploit in the shell library could theoretically read another user's files. Consider row-level security or separate D1 databases per user.

### Workspace persistence

- **`run_bundled_code` entry point detection is fragile** — the `@cloudflare/worker-bundler` `createWorker` call uses a dummy entry to resolve packages. If the bundler can't find an entry point it returns an error. Needs a more robust approach (e.g. explicit `entryPoint` option once available).
- **Workspace reads/writes in the DO are not transactional** — concurrent `run_code` calls from the same user could produce race conditions in D1. Consider wrapping multi-step workspace operations in a single sandbox execution.
- **No workspace quotas** — a single user could fill D1 with large files. Add a per-user file size limit enforced at the `run_code` tool level.

### Auth & multi-tenancy

- **One DO per MCP session, not per user** — `McpAgent.serve()` creates a fresh DO for each MCP session. The workspace is persistent (D1), but any in-memory state (e.g. caches) resets between sessions. This is correct behaviour but worth being aware of.
- **No token refresh** — OpenCode stores the OAuth token and uses it until it expires. If the Access session TTL is short (< 24h), users will need to re-authenticate. Consider increasing the Access session duration to 7 days for internal tools.
- **No rate limiting** — `run_code` creates a new Dynamic Worker on every call. Add a per-user rate limit via Cloudflare's Rate Limiting binding if you onboard many users.

### Developer experience

- **Domain tools (`codemode.*`) are hardcoded** — every user shares the same set of domain tools. A future improvement would let each user or team define their own tool set, loaded from KV or a separate Worker.
- **No streaming** — `run_code` returns the full result synchronously. For long-running code, consider returning a task ID and polling, or streaming logs via SSE.
- **`run_bundled_code` is slow** — bundles packages at runtime by fetching from the npm registry. Cache the bundled module map in KV keyed by the package manifest hash.
- **GitPrism creates a new MCP client per call** — the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `Client` is stateless (GitPrism is stateless) so this is correct, but it adds connection overhead. Pool or reuse connections if GitPrism adds stateful features.

### Operations

- **No observability** — add `observability: { enabled: true }` to `wrangler.jsonc` and instrument `run_code` calls with timing and error metrics.
- **No workspace TTL** — files live forever. Add a DO Alarm on first write that cleans up workspace files older than N days.
- **Admin dashboard has no pagination** — the `GET /admin/api/users` endpoint returns all users at once. Add cursor-based pagination once the user count grows.
